<i>YADS Data Model</i></h1>
<hr>
The following figures trace the evolution of resolving a DOI 
public identifier: "Single Resolution", "Multiple Resolution", 
and leading now to what we might better term "Services Resolution".
<p>
YADS, a description service, is a model which has been
developed to support "Services Resolution".
<hr>
<i><b>Single Resolution</b></i>
<p>
This is the current position with DOI - one DOI resolves to one URL. This is what is currently implemented in the
<a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> application of DOI by the scholarly publishing community.
<p>
<i>Fig. 1: Single resolution of a DOI. (<a href="fig1.xml">Example</a>)</i>
<p>

<p>
Essentially this provides similar functionality to a PURL - a Persistent URL: namely, a redirect service.
<p>
<hr>
<i><b>Multiple Resolution</b></i>
<p>
The next step in the evolution is the "One to Many" scenario.
 The demo
DOIs for <a href="http://www.dlib.org">D-Lib</a> magazine issues which link mirror sites
hosting the D-Lib issue can be resolved this way.
<p>
<i>Fig. 2: Multiple resolution of a DOI. (<a href="fig2.xml">Example</a>)</i>
<p>

<p>
The main problem with this approach is that a resolution service can't tell what to return
- a single URL, or multiple URLs. And worse, there is no meaningful
presentation for the end user. Raw URLs by and large are generally undecipherable strings.
<p>
<hr>
<i><b>Services Resolution</b></i>
<p>
What is needed is not a resolution to data elements but a resolution to services.
The DOI Technical Work Group is
aiming to supply a general framework for enabling DOI Services.
<p>
Consistently structured and descriptive resource hierarchies associated with DOIs are a prerequisite for the deployment of DOI Services.
Here we describe YADS, a description service model which attempts this.
<p>
We first generalize the data element type URL
to be a generic <b><i>resource</i></b> which may be another DOI resource (a URI of scheme "doi:"), a familiar web
 resource, or an inline resource (as presented in a URI of scheme "data:").
These <b><i>resources</i></b> are qualified as required by <b><i>properties</i></b> (see <a href="properties.html">Model Properties</a>)
such as "detail" (a human readable description), "label" (a presentational element), etc.
which together make up a composite resource <b><i>item</i></b>.
<p>
<i>Fig. 3: YADS resource &amp; item.
(Example <a href="fig3.xml">XML</a> and <a href="fig3.html">SVG</a>)
</i>
<p>
<img src='resource.gif'>
<p>
These resource <b><i>items</i></b> are then gathered into <b><i>collections</i></b> which have
inherent orderings: "unordered", "sequenced", or "choice".
<p>
<i>Fig. 4: YADS collection.
(Example <a href="fig4.xml">XML</a> and <a href="fig4.html">SVG</a>)
</i>
<p>
<img src='group.gif'>
<p>
Note that if an <b><i>item</i></b> contains a <b><i>collection</i></b> instead of a <b><i>resource</i></b> a
complete resource hierarchy can be built up.
<p>
<i>Fig. 5: YADS resource hierarchy.
(Example <a href="fig5.xml">XML</a> and <a href="fig5.html">SVG</a>)
</i>
<p>
<img src='group1.gif'>
<p>
Each resource hierarchy is to be interpreted by a particular DOI application (eg 
<a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a>). Multiple
hierarchies can be supported by binding the hierarchies to
   a DOI resource describing the application that can service the respective
hierarhcy - the application profile. A <b><i>resource</i></b>/<b><i>collection</i></b> pairing
such as this is termed a <b><i>nest</i></b>.
<p>
<i>Fig. 6: YADS nests.
(Example <a href="fig6.xml">XML</a> and <a href="fig6.html">SVG</a>)
</i>
<p>
<img src='nest.gif'>
<p>
And because the DOI resource itself is bound to a <b><i>collection</i></b> of profiles there
exists a toplevel <b><i>nest</i></b>.
