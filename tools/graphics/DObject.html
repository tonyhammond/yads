Essentially this provides similar functionality to a PURL - a Persistent URL.</i>

<i><b>Fig. 2.</b> DOI Multiple Resolution. This is the 'One to Many' scenario - multiple URLs but 
with no
indication of their relationship. The demo DOIs for D-Lib magazine issues which link mirror sites
hosting D-Lib magazine
can be resolved this way. The problem with this approach is that one doesn't know what to return
to the end user - a single URL, or multiple URLs. Also one has no means of presenting this information 
- URLs in their raw state are at best unpalatable.</i>

<i><b>Fig. 3.</b> DOI Articulate Resolution. This is the vision of the DOI-SDI project which is
aiming to provide a framework to link multiple resources. The resources are qualified by properties
and are arranged into a hierarchy and with ordering.</i>
