The following figures trace the evolution of resolving a DOI as a network identifier: "Single Resolution", "Multiple Resolution", 
and now leading to what we might best term "Intelligent Resolution".
<p>
<i><b>DOI Single Resolution</b></i>
<br>
This is the current position with DOI - one DOI resolves to one URL. This is what is being currently implemented in CrossRef.
<p>

<p>
Essentially this provides similar functionality to a PURL - a Persistent URL.
<p>
<i><b>DOI Multiple Resolution</b></i>
<br>
The next step in the evolution is the "One to Many" scenario.
 The demo DOIs for D-Lib magazine issues which link mirror sites
hosting D-Lib magazine can be resolved this way.
<p>

<p>
The problem with this approach is that one doesn't know what to return
to the end user - a single URL, or multiple URLs. Also one has no means of presenting this information 
- URLs in their raw state are at best an unpalatable mouthful for the end user.
<p>
<i><b>DOI Intelligent Resolution</b></i>
<br>
This is a goal of the DOI-SDI project which is
aiming to supply a general framework for linking multiple resources. First we generalize the URL
to any arbitrary resource which may be another DObject, a general web resource, or a literal (as presented in a
URI of scheme "data:").
The resources are qualified as required by <a href="properties.html">Model Properties</a>
such as "detail" (a human readable description), "label" (a presentational element), etc.
which together make up a composite resource group.
<p>

<p>
These resource groups are then arranged within containers which have
inherent orderings of: "unordered", "sequence", or "alternatives".
<p>
<img src='imx/group.gif'>
<p>
Note that group members may also be containers (ie have a property "contains") so that a
complete resource hierarchy can be built up.
<p>

<p>
Each resource hierarchy is to be interpreted by a particular DOI application (eg 
CrossRef). Multiple
hierarchies can be supported by adding a system property "profile" which is a DObject describing the
application profile.
